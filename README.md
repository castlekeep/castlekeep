Castlekeep
=========

Castlekeep is an isometric castle build simulator, which takes place in the european middle age. It's about creating a colony after your imagination - from a little village to a whole kingdom. You have to organize everything by yourself - construction, economy and defense - just like in real life, in a real community. But of course it's not only about creating a kingdom successfully, you also have to keep an eye on enemies who are in the most cases not that far away from you, waiting for their chance to attack.
